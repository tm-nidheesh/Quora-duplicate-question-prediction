# Quora-duplicate-question-prediction

Quora is a popular question-and-answer platform where users can ask, answer, and edit questions on a variety of topics. 
The Quora duplicate question pair project aims to develop a machine learning model that can identify whether two given questions on Quora are duplicates or not. 

The objective of this project is to improve the user experience on Quora by reducing the number of duplicate questions, thereby making it easier for users to find relevant information. The model is trained on a large dataset of question pairs labeled as either duplicates or not duplicates. The dataset is used to train a machine learning algorithm, which can then predict whether a new pair of questions is a duplicate or not.

The project involves several steps, including data collection, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and model evaluation. 
The data is collected from: https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs
and preprocessed to remove noise, stop words, and other irrelevant information. Features such as TF-IDF vectors are used to represent the questions in a meaningful way.

The model was build using random forest are trained on the preprocessed data to predict whether a given question pair is a duplicate or not. 
The performance of each model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Overall, the Quora duplicate question pair project is an important application of machine learning and natural language processing techniques to improve the user experience on Quora by reducing the number of duplicate questions.
